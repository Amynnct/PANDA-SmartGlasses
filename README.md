**Leveraging Augmented Reality (AR) holographic displays, these glasses
transform spoken language into real-time text(using Assembly AI), projecting it onto
holographic film to create a 3D textual representation. This device is also capable of translation
from English to other languages. Equipped with voice assistance(using the GPT 3.5 Turbo
model), these Smart Glasses seamlessly integrate into daily life, facilitating effortless
communication in diverse scenarios. Future iterations aim to incorporate an Internet of Things
(IoT) interface, expanding these glasses into personal assistants, and enabling control of smart
devices through voice commands or gestures. This endeavor addresses the pressing need for
inclusive communication solutions that transcend language barriers and accommodate the needs
of the hard of hearing, fostering a more connected and inclusive society**
